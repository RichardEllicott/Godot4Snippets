# Godot4Snippets
my code snippets

this is a library of mostly copy paste solutions of patterns i use, and some objects for slightly more difficult problems


i found making a scapbook library like this to be useful as designing a propper library can be time consuming and often breaks as you change things, often it's easier to paste a couple of helper functions direct to a script


organisation here is not great but basicly everything useful is mostly inside the snippets folder



i always use the latest stable Godot, so now all snippets will be made to work with Godot 4.2
