"""

it is difficult to stop Godot's pathfinding getting stuck with any settings

this solution works with these NavigationRegion3D settings:

Cells:
    size = 0.06
    height = 0.06
Agents:
    radius = 0.4 # fits through 1 meter gaps

the actual CharacterBody3D can have an actual collider with radius of 0.4 and height 1.5 and not get stuck
